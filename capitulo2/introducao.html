    <p>This extensively revised and updated fourth edition not only examines the new geographical patterns forming within and between cities, 
        but also investigates the way geographers have sought to make sense of this urban transformation. 
        It is structured into three sections: ‘contexts’, ‘themes’ and ‘issues’ that move students from a foundation in urban geography through its major themes to contemporary and pressing issues. 
        The fourth edition combines the topicality and accessibility of previous editions with extensive new material, including many new chapters such as an urban world and politics, 
        housing and residential segregation, and transport in cities, as well as a wealth of international case studies, 
        extending its range of coverage across the field. This book features enhanced pedagogy including a range of new illustrations and tables, 
        a list of key ideas for each chapter, end of chapter essay questions and project activities, and annotated further reading from books, 
        journals and websites. Written in an engaging, student-friendly style, this is an essential read for students and scholars of urban geography.

    <p>We live in an urban world, or more accurately many different urban worlds. In July 2007, for the first time in human history, 
        the majority of the world’s population resided in cities. This event, hailed as monumental in much media coverage, was, 
        in itself, of little more than symbolic importance. The trends, most notably massive urban growth in the Global South, 
        had been apparent for some time and show no sign of slowing down, let alone reversing. It is against this background, 
        a growing, dynamic urban world characterized by increasing interconnection and inequality that faces challenges in the near future including peak oil and probable climate chaos, 
        that this book invites you into the world of urban geography. Urban geography texts always argue that their publication coincides with exciting and challenging times for the city. 
        They are always correct. Whatever cities might be they are never boring. 
        The dynamic and diverse nature of the urban world presents a significant challenge for those attempting to write a textbook to guide students through its complexities. 
        For a general textbook, the aim should be to provide the student with as comprehensive an overview as possible. However this is always only ever partially fulfilled. 
        Textbooks, such as this one, are written by authors who approach the study of the city in particular ways, drawing on their own set of knowledge and experiences. 
        Who writes the book and where they are based matters. This has been a key issue raised about urban geographical writing on the city, 
        where it has been pointed out that in reality universal ideas and theories about the city are only ever partial (see for example Robinson 2005a). 
        This is a book written first and foremost for students. Its objective, therefore, is to equip you, 
        the student with enough knowledge of cities and the ways that they have been thought about and researched, primarily but not exclusively from within urban geography, 
        to allow you to understand key aspects of cities and to become an urban geographer in your own right. As a student of urban geography,
        or one of its many cognate disciplines, you are likely to encounter cities and to address urban questions in many different

    <p>It is therefore an important starting point for researchers and writers to acknowledge and understand their own perspective and position in any piece of work. 
       We are two urban geographers who were born and brought up in the United Kingdom (UK) and who have worked mainly in UK universities. 
       Our professional discussions and experience have mainly been with others in Europe and North America. This has inevitably shaped our approaches to studying cities.
       While we have tried to move beyond the specifics of our urban experiences in this book, by focusing on exploring the broader processes shaping cities, 
       where we make these abstract ideas concrete we will often draw on examples from our own experiences. Therefore, the coverage of examples used and issues raised will, 
       like other textbooks, not reflect the urban world in all its diversity. This is where we invite you to build on what we have written here and to add your own perspectives and experiences. 
       Throughout the book we have tried to offer you exercises and opportunities to reflect on your own knowledge of the urban and to consider the ways in which the urban realities that you inhabit and experience are shaped by these broader processes. 
       So let us begin with your urban geographies . . .
